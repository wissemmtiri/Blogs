## INTRODUCTION

- **_What is SHELL ?_**

  - A shell is a text-based command **interpreter** that acts as a bridge between the user and the system, translating input commands into instructions the operating system understands.
  - **Examples:**
    - The Bourne Shell (**sh**)
    - The GNU Bourne-Again Shell (**bash**)
    - The Z Shell (**zsh**)

- **_Problem_**
  - Maintaining consistency across multiple servers through manual configuration can be exhaustive and error-prone, especially when dealing with intricate command sequences. Re-executing hundreds of individual commands becomes impractical and susceptible to human error.s
- **_Solution_**
  - Shell script files (**.sh**) offer a powerful solution to this challenge. By grouping all necessary commands into a single script, you can streamline and automate the configuration process. Executing the script once applies the entire configuration to your server, saving time and ensuring consistency.
